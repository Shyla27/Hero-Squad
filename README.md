### Set it up 
Step 1: 
Go to github and search for my username :Shyla27 and clone the repo using  this  link:https://github.com/Shyla27/Hero-Squad.git.
 Step 2:
 Open the project with Intellij or any text editor in my case i was using Visual Studio.
Step 3:
On your terminal type gradle run in order to run the app from your local machine.
 Step 4:
Open localhost:4567  in your browser; 
### How it works 
Assuming you have the app in your computer already,lets begin 
So you'll need to create a squad or use the squads in the game already
once you've done that you'll get to see a list of all squads and the number of heroes assigned to each.
if you'd like to create a new hero to a specific squad just click on the number and it will redirect you to a new page where you'll now create the hero you want to.
basically that's it. 
Have fun
